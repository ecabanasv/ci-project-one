                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-city fa"></i> City of Portree</h2>
                <p>The name of Portree comes from the Gaelic "Port-an-Righ" which in English translates as "King's Port". Formerly known as Kiltraglen, this town is believed to have changed its name after King James V of Scotland undertook a persuasive voyage to the island accompanied by his fleet of warships. There he tried to unite the clans of MacLeods and MacDonalds in order to get them to support his interests.</p>
                <p>Portree is known for being the scene of several historical events in the country. It was at the Royal Hotel (formerly MacNab's Inn) that Bonnie Prince Charlie took his last farewell in 1746 to Flora MacDonald, a fact that would lead to the popular song and theme song of the Outlander series "The Skye Boat Song". Also from its port, many people left for North America at the beginning of the 18th century, a time of famine and overpopulation on the island.</p>
                <p>In the 19th century Portree became known as the business center of Skye, as it was easily accessible by steamers from Glasgow. It was during this period that the city began to take on more tourist prominence, becoming the busy region it is today. In fact, the number of tourists has acquired such a dimension that the occupation of the city doubles during the high season of visits.
                </p>
                <p>If you like the literary saga of Harry Potter, surely this city would already sound familiar to you, since it gives its name to one of the Quiddich teams, the Pride of Portree. Portree is reference in the movie “My Girlfriend's Wedding” as well.</p>

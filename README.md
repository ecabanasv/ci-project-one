# 1. User Expereince (UX) design
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
  
The Isle of Skye is the best known of the Highlands, the most appreciated and fascinating, also known as the Isle of Fairies for its impressive landscapes and hidden places. These remote lands of the North of Scotland, which have so inspired writers and painters, continue to arouse great admiration among travellers. The Isle of Skye was always separated from British soil until a bridge was built in 1995 linking the towns of Kyleakin and Kyle of Lochalsh.
  
Known simply as The Island, it has served as an inspiration for artists and travellers, a relief for sailors and a refuge for kings. But it is also home to fairies and giants, some of Scotland's best whiskey and cliffs that defy the north.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) it is the software that has been used to develop the wireframes of the web. It was very useful to start the idea of the project and with it, I was able to quickly generate the code of the web structure. Captures developed with the Balsamiq program are attached below.

# 1. UX design
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)
  
The Isle of Skye is the best known of the Highlands, the most appreciated and fascinating, also known as the Isle of Fairies for its impressive landscapes and hidden places. These remote lands of the North of Scotland, which have so inspired writers and painters, continue to arouse great admiration among travellers. The Isle of Skye was always separated from British soil until a bridge was built in 1995 linking the towns of Kyleakin and Kyle of Lochalsh.
  
Known simply as The Island, it has served as an inspiration for artists and travellers, a relief for sailors and a refuge for kings. But it is also home to fairies and giants, some of Scotland's best whiskey and cliffs that defy the north.

The following types of users can benefit from the use of this website:

* Students trips (Regular students, Language students etc)
* Regular travelers (Solo, Families, Hikers)
* Professionals (Archaeologists, Historians, Gaelic students/teachers)

* HTML: #white
* container: #floralwhite

# 5. Bugs
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

### Solved bugs
- Wrong head titles in articles and article-3, article-1 and contact. After copy and paste same title I figured out after a while they were incorrect.
- Change some div tags to semantic html tags in all pages after reviewed by a peer in Slack channel. They were all divs, now seems more correct.
- Different html validator errors in images (no alt tags). Corrected after include all the images in the repository.
- Fixed the resizing on index (from 500px to 800px, check style.css grid css). After resize the browser in between those values articles on index.html had bad visualization.
- Added arial-labels in input form fields after being recommended by mentor Marcel.
